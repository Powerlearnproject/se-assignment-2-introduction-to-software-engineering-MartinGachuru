Question 1
Define Software Engineering:
This is the process of creating, appraising, and running application software while applying the required engineering approaches (Yasar, 2024).
Question 2
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? 
Software engineering entails computer programming and application development via information technology. Software engineering entails projects that test unique elements while traditional engineering entails projects involving tested and known approaches (Geekforgeeks, 2024). 
Question 3
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase. 
1.      Planning
This entails collecting requirements from the project’s clients or stakeholders. Planning entails evaluating the project’s feasibility, cost, needs, end-user requirements, and internal rate of return (Clark, 2024).
2.      Defining requirements 
The collected requirements are synthesized for implementation by the development team using different documents such as the software requirement specification and use case document.
3.      Design
This is where the process of implementing the vision is documented in the programming language, platforms, templates, and buffer measures.
4.      Development 
The development team subdivides the project and writes code to actualize the software.
5.      Testing
Testing is essential to evaluate if the software meets the initial deliverables. Testing comprises performance, security, functional, unit, and usability testing.
6.      Deployment
The software can be delivered to the users in stages or to a smaller number of users. For instance, a bank may release an online application to its employees before releasing it to the customers.
7.      Maintenance 
Maintenance is the last phase in waterfall structures but could be undertaken continuously in agile approaches (Hoory, 2024). Emerging bugs and errors that are commonly found by users are solved in the maintenance stage.
Summary
SDLC is an economical approach used in the design and development of software. SDLC facilitates planning to ensure that the developers meet or exceed the necessary deliverables (AWS, n.d). 
Question 4
Agile vs. Waterfall Models: Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? 
Comparison
•	Testing is essential to both methods (Lockhart, 2023).
•	Both methodologies entail planning for formulating the schedule, objectives, and resources.
•	Both have the objectives of producing high-quality applications that meet users’ deliverables.
•	They entail the same operations of the collection, development, design, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
Contrast 
•	The waterfall approach is rigid to the scope of the project while the agile approach is adaptable to changes.
•	The waterfall approach requires the completion of the entire work before the final release while the agile approach allows the delivery of value over shorter periods.
•	The waterfall approach necessitates the completion of a specific phase before moving the subsequent module while the agile approach enables the team members to work on different phases of the project.
•	In the waterfall approach testing is undertaken towards the final delivery but undertaken incrementally in agile approaches.
•	The waterfall approach relies on detailed documentation compared to the agile approach.
•	In the waterfall approach formal communication is common such as in the delivery of reports while the agile approach allows informal communication to improve interactions.
•	The waterfall approach is linear where all the requirements are set before the start of the project while the agile approach follows a flexible approach where new information is integrated continuously.
•	In the waterfall approach specific roles and responsibilities are assigned to each of the team members while the agile approach requires close collaboration amongst team members on different project functionalities.
•	The waterfall approach is suited for longer deadlines while the agile approach is suited for creating value over short-term deadlines over iterative cycles. 
Differences in when to use each
The waterfall approach fits projects that are limited in scope, clear, and linear. The waterfall methodology should be implemented in case of predictable deliverables, structured processes, rigid measures of control, and involvement of the long-term commitment of different parties. 
Agile projects are ideal for complex deliverables over shorter periods, in case of frequent refinements and iterations, involvement of multiple stakeholders, evolving requirements, and collaborative requirements.  
Question 5
Requirements Engineering: What are requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle. 
Requirements engineering is the approach of the identification, synthesis, analysis, validation, and management of the requirements and expectations of software stakeholders. The process of requirements engineering entails the analysis of the economic, operational, and technical feasibility. The next step entails eliciting the requirements and gaining knowledge about the project from various such as using focus groups, interviews, surveys, and prototyping. The third step entails specifying the requirements using models such as function decomposition diagrams and data flow diagrams. The fourth step entails verifying that the software performs its functions and validating different tasks to ensure that the software meets the customer's problems. The fifth stage entails conforming to changing requirements by assessing, prioritizing, and tracking communication. 
Importance 
•	Ensures that the software meets user needs including quality levels.
•	Allows identification of issues and subsequent adjustment.
•	Reduces costs and time of project development.
•	Improves collaboration between stakeholders and the team.
•	Provides a foundation, streamlines development, and minimizes errors.
Question 6
Software Design Principles: Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve the maintainability and scalability of software systems? 
Modularity is the process of partitioning a system into independent components and modules each with their specific operations and functionality. Independent modules of the software facilitate the adaptation, extension, and replacement of specific components of an application or system without affecting the rest of the components. Modularity allows the addition or removal of new features and reduces the pressures of adding new loads, which improves scalability. Modularity enhances maintainability by reducing complexity, isolating changes, and improving readability.
Question 7
Testing in Software Engineering: Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development? 
Unit testing is the primary mode of testing undertaken by the developers before being assessed by the testing team. Every component of the software is isolated and individual tests are undertaken to ensure that each of the components meets the planned output. Unit testing is cheaper and assesses the behavior of the codes.
Integration testing is the secondary-level testing undertaken using tools such as Selenium rather than the developers to ensure that the individual components run smoothly when separated from the group. Integration testing increases coverage, pinpoints issues of integration, enhances reliability and ensures that bugs are detected early. 
System testing is the tertiary-level testing that entails the identification of challenges and bugs that can constrain software requirements, usually undertaken by specialized teams. It is crucial to ensure that the final products meet the project’s deliverables and that it runs smoothly. System testing solves post-production issues, enhances end-to-end testing of software, assesses business requirements, and analyzes the architecture of the software. 
Acceptance testing is the ultimate testing level conducted comprehensively before the software is deployed publicly. User testing facilitates the identification of problems before they reach users and improves stakeholder satisfaction. 
Question 8
Version Control Systems: What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features. 
Version control systems are tools for recording file changes by tracking source code modifications. They are important as they specify the developer who made the changes when they were made, and rationale. This facilitates effective communication, collaboration, and learning among different developers. Also, they improve authenticity, speed, organization, and productivity as the changes to the source code are only merged after authentication. They reduce conflicts and errors by ensuring developers communicate effectively regardless of their geographical limitations.  
Local version control systems (CVCS) have patch sets placed uniquely on disks. It can recreate what the files looked like at a specific time by adding the patches. Centralized version control systems have a global repository where users can commit to make changes while others can view the updates. CVCS provides insights into the input of everyone in the project and allows the administrators to control the updates.
Distributed version control systems allow developers to make individual changes by committing, pushing, pulling, and updating. 
Question 9
Software Project Management: Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects? 
Roles
•	Planning and developing the idea
•	Establishing the objectives of the project
•	Analyzing the project’s constraints 
•	Coordinating team activities
•	Constructing the timelines of the project 
•	Monitoring performance
•	Meeting stakeholders’ satisfaction
Responsibilities 
•	Project estimation 
•	Scheduling 
•	Staffing
•	Risk management 
•	Implementing miscellaneous plans
Challenges 
Challenges include management risks, time and cost constraints, changing project priorities and requirements, team motivation, steep learning curves, and high competition.
Question 10
Software Maintenance: Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle? 
Software maintenance is the process of change, modification, and update of system software to meet the needs of the customer. Corrective requirements include fixing defects, adaptive maintenance includes adaptation to the environment, preventive maintenance entails the prevention of problems, and perfective maintenance entails improving attributes. 
Maintenance ensures that the software remains useful and does not become obsolete. Identification and tracking involve determining the parts of the software that need to be modified. Documentation is essential for maintenance as it includes how the code works, solutions, and potential problems.
Question 11
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering: What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Common ethical issues in software engineering include data privacy such as data minimization, user content, and third-party sharing, accessibility comprising of equality, diversity, and inclusive technology, addictive design of applications and systems, algorithmic bias, and software security issues.
Engineers should write well-documented and clean code that can be maintained easily. They should implement robust. They should improve encryption to protect user data, undertake robust authentication, and prioritize security measures. Engineers should test the software for accuracy, reliability, and security during the testing phase. They should consider potential biases and implement steps of mitigation (Institute of Data, 2023).
